# Getting started with Angular

- I developed a simple shopping website in angular

- The shopping website had the following components

1. A homepage that displayed all the phones available for users.

2. A details page that desplayed all the details of a given phone 

3. A shipping page that displayed all the shipping prices.

- The website also had a cart service that displayed all the phones that had been added to the cart and their prices.
